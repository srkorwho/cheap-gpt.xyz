Cheap-GPT acts as a lightweight ChatGPT-style interface powered by the OpenAI API.
It allows users to interact with different OpenAI models in a clean, responsive chat environment.

The key feature:
When the "Cheap" mode is enabled, user messages are automatically translated into Traditional Chinese before being sent to the model, and then translated back to the userâ€™s original language upon response.
Since Traditional Chinese often uses fewer tokens, this approach can reduce API costs while keeping the same conversational meaning.

This process reduces token usage and helps you chat smarter for less.
