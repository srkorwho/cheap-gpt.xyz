Cheap-GPT is a modern, minimal, and elegant web app designed to make AI chat more affordable by optimizing token usage through intelligent language translation.

🌍 Overview

Cheap-GPT acts as a lightweight ChatGPT-style interface powered by the OpenAI API.
It allows users to interact with different OpenAI models in a clean, responsive chat environment.

The key feature:
When the "Cheap" mode is enabled, user messages are automatically translated into Traditional Chinese before being sent to the model, and then translated back to the user’s original language upon response.
Since Traditional Chinese often uses fewer tokens, this approach can reduce API costs while keeping the same conversational meaning.


🧠 How It Works
The user enters a message in any language.
If Cheap Mode is active:
The system detects the language.
Translates the text to Traditional Chinese.
Sends it to the OpenAI API.
Translates the AI’s response back to the user’s original language.
If Normal Mode is active, no translation occurs.

This process reduces token usage and helps you chat smarter for less.
